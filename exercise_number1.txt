Exercise number 1 in getting to know GIT and Github (.com or .fmi.fi)

The exercise consists of the following parts:
1 - Create an account (if you don't already have one) on github.com and/or github.fmi.fi (this will need help from IT)
	Also note that acces to .fmi.fi requires you to be in internal network.

2 - Locate and clone the practice repository:
	https://github.fmi.fi/siirias/GitDemonstrationQuacamole
	or
	https://github.com/siirias/GitDemonstrationQuacamole

3 - From there you should find a file called exercise_number1.txt. Add your name to the list of persons successfully completing this exercise.

4 - Unless you were already added as a collaborator to either repository, message Simo your GitHub account name.
    He'll add you to the project so you can contribute your changes.

5 - Push your changes into either repository to record your success.

Providing you manage to do all these steps, you should have the rudimentary understanding of
how Git and GitHub work, and be able to test co-operation with others.

Also, there is a text file for questions and suggestions. With your new powers, feel free to add there ideas.

# Clone the repo (pick one)

# Make your change
# (edit exercise_number1.txt with your name)
